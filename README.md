Hello and welcome to marineSABRES WP5 Task 5.3 code sharing platform!

loop_analysis.r goes through loop analysis of signed SES in R

boolean.r goes through stability analyses for boolean network

the current plan is to use boolean approaches as an entry point to understand a freshly produced SES and then
move to semi-quantitative (loop analysis) for a subset of possible states as well as quantitative simulations (matrix projection) to answer more precise questions
